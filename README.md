Hi @everyone in the Linux Alpha channel,

For Windows and Mac we will be releasing version 4.0. This requires the mobile version 4.0 as well.
⚠️  The new mobile version 4.0 however does NOT work with the v3.1 version so all Linux users should stay at the 3.1 builds on their mobile devices.  ⚠️ 

This is especially important for iOS because you cannot go back a version once you have installed it.

When the first week after release is over and most bugs of version 4.0 have been reported and fixed I plan to get the Linux version also to v4.0. Until then, please do not update your mobile versions.
